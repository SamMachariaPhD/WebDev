## Getting started with HTML

### Documentation/Datasheet

> In programming, it is very important to have a documentation/datasheet
of the language you want to program in.

> For HTML documentation and others, you can visit devdocs.io

### Heading

<h1> First heading </h1>
<h6> Last heading </h6>
<h3> Third heading </h3>
<br> break the line (spacing)

### Anatomy of HTML tags

1. opening tag. e.g. "<h1>"
2. content. e.g. "First heading"
3. closing tag. e.g. "</h1>"

Some tags are 'self-closing' tags e.g. "<br>"
In this case, the closing tags maybe omitted.
Another example is horizontal rule, <hr>

<hr size="3">
hr = HTML element
size="3" = HTML attribute

HTML attribute provides more information to the browser.
For example, the 'size="3"' attribute specifies to the browser the size of 
the horizontal rule.
