## How the Internet works

> The Internet is simply a long piece of wire connecting different computers.

> If you visit https://www.submarinecablemap.com/ you will see a map of this
giant Internet cable running around the globe. This is the Internet backbone.
The underwater cables, the inland cables, and the wireless connections that
link all these computers together.

> The computers that keep the Internet running are always powered on 24/7
ready to be used. We may refer to these kind of computers as SERVER(S).

> Your computer does not have to be always connected to the Internet but
you use it to access various websites in the Internet. We may refer to your
computer as the CLIENT computer.

> The web SERVER is packed with data/information that CLIENTs are interested in.

### How googling works

> Lets say that you want to visit google.com. Your computer/phone is the CLIENT.
You open your favorite browser and go to www.google.com

> A message request is send to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) --
these are the company(s) you pay to be able to access the Internet.

> The ISP relays that message to Domain Name System Server (DNS server).
DNS server is like a phone book. It looks up the exact IP address of the
computer corresponding to the domain name you want to visit.
For example, www.google.com = 216.58.210.46
You can think of IP address as the postal address or an identification number (ID).

> Having got the correct IP address, accessing the server via the Internet backbone
 becomes possible.

> The server then send back the files that the client requested.
All computers (both the client and the server) has an IP address.

> For the website, the server computers have files organized in a way that a
client can access, that is, a website.
